## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a robust text classification pipeline to categorize tweets into predefined labels. We explore various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to achieve this task.

## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is performed using the TfidfVectorizer, which converts text data into numerical features based on term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).

## Model Training

The following models are trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow Neural Network

Each model is trained on the extracted features, and their performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## Hyper-parameter Tuning

GridSearchCV is used to perform hyper-parameter tuning for each model. This process involves testing different combinations of hyper-parameters to find the best settings for each model.

Example for Logistic Regression:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'solver': ['liblinear', 'saga']
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
best_params_lr = grid_search.best_params_
print(f"Best parameters for LogisticRegression: {best_params_lr}")
```

## Performance

The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy and detailed classification reports. Below is an example of how the performance is reported:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

y_pred_lr = lr_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
print("Logistic Regression Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_lr))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_lr))
```

## Future Improvements

### Feature Engineering

* N-grams: Incorporate bi-grams or tri-grams in the TfidfVectorizer to capture more context in the text data.

* Domain-specific Features: Add features specific to the domain, such as named entity recognition (NER) tags, sentiment scores, or part-of-speech tags.

* Word Embeddings: Use word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo) to capture semantic relationships between words.

### Model Complexity

* Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques like stacking, blending, or bagging to combine predictions from multiple models for better generalization.

* Deep Learning Models: Experiment with more complex neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for text classification tasks.

### Hyper-parameter Optimization

* Automated Hyper-parameter Tuning: Use automated hyper-parameter tuning libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt to find the optimal hyper-parameters more efficiently.

### Data Augmentation

* Synthetic Data Generation: Use techniques like data augmentation or synthetic data generation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
